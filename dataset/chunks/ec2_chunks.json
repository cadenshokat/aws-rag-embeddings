  "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide What is Amazon EC2? Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 reduces hardware costs so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, conﬁgure security and networking, and manage storage. You can add capacity (scale up) to handle compute-heavy tasks, such as monthly or yearly processes, or spikes in website traﬃc. When usage decreases, you can reduce capacity (scale down) again. An EC2 instance is a virtual server in the AWS Cloud. When you launch an EC2 instance, the instance type that you specify determines the hardware available to your instance. Each instance type oﬀers a diﬀerent balance of compute, memory, network, and storage resources. For more information, see the Amazon EC2 Instance Types Guide. Features of Amazon EC2 Amazon EC2 provides the following high-level features: Instances Virtual servers. Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) Preconﬁgured templates for your instances that package the components you need for your server (including the operating system and additional software). Instance types Various conﬁgurations of CPU, memory, storage, networking capacity, and graphics hardware for your instances. Features 1 Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide Amazon EBS volumes Persistent storage volumes for your data using Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS). Instance store volumes Storage volumes for temporary data that is deleted when you stop, hibernate, or terminate your instance. Key pairs Secure login information for your instances. AWS stores the public key and you store the private key in a secure place. Security groups A virtual ﬁrewall that allows you to specify the protocols, ports, and source IP ranges that can reach your instances, and the destination IP ranges to",
  "and source IP ranges that can reach your instances, and the destination IP ranges to which your instances can connect. Amazon EC2 supports the processing, storage, and transmission of credit card data by a merchant or service provider, and has been validated as being compliant with Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS). For more information about PCI DSS, including how to request a copy of the AWS PCI Compliance Package, see PCI DSS Level 1.

The following is an example response: Warning: Permanently added 'ec2-198-51-100-1.useast-2.compute.amazonaws.com' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts. Windows instances To connect to a Windows instance using RDP, you must retrieve the initial administrator password and then enter this password when you connect to your instance. It takes a few minutes after instance launch before this password is available. Your account must have permission to call the GetPasswordData action. For more information, see Example policies to control access the Amazon EC2 API. The default username for the Administrator account depends on the language of the operating system (OS) contained in the AMI. To determine the correct username, identify the language of the OS, and then choose the corresponding username. For example, for an English OS, the username is Administrator, for a French OS it's Administrateur, and for a Portuguese OS it's Administrador. If a language version of the OS does not have a username in the same language, choose the username Administrator (Other). For more information, see Localized Names for Administrator Account in Windows in the Microsoft website. To retrieve the initial administrator password 1.

  "choose Open, and select the .rdp ﬁle from your Downloads folder. 4. By default, Computer is the public IPv4 DNS name of the instance and User name is the administrator account. To connect to the instance using IPv6 instead, replace the public IPv4 DNS name of the instance with its IPv6 address. Review the default settings and change them as needed. 5. Choose Connect. If you receive a warning that the publisher of the remote connection is unknown, choose Connect to continue. 6. Enter the password that you saved previously, and then choose OK. 7. Due to the nature of self-signed certiﬁcates, you might get a warning that the security certiﬁcate could not be authenticated. Do one of the following: • If you trust the certiﬁcate, choose Yes to connect to your instance. Step 2: Connect to your instance 14 Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud • User Guide [Windows] Before you proceed, compare the thumbprint of the certiﬁcate with the value in the system log to conﬁrm the identity of the remote computer. Choose View certiﬁcate and then choose Thumbprint from the Details tab. Compare this value to the value of RDPCERTIFICATE-THUMBPRINT in Actions, Monitor and troubleshoot, Get system log. • [Mac OS X] Before you proceed, compare the ﬁngerprint of the certiﬁcate with the value in the system log to conﬁrm the identity of the remote computer. Choose Show Certiﬁcate, expand Details, and choose SHA1 Fingerprints. Compare this value to the value of RDPCERTIFICATE-THUMBPRINT in Actions, Monitor and troubleshoot, Get system log. 8. If the RDP connection is successful, the RDP client displays the Windows login screen and then the Windows desktop. If you receive an error message instead, see the section called “Remote Desktop can't connect to the remote computer”. When you are ﬁnished with the RDP connection, you",
  "can't connect to the remote computer”. When you are ﬁnished with the RDP connection, you can close the RDP client. Step 3: Clean up your instance After you've ﬁnished with the instance that you created for this tutorial, you should clean up by terminating the instance. If you want to do more with this instance before you clean up, see Next steps. Important Terminating an instance eﬀectively deletes it; you can't reconnect to an instance after you've terminated it. You'll stop incurring charges for that instance or usage that counts against your Free Tier limits as soon as the instance status changes to shutting down or terminated. To keep your instance for later, but not incur charges or usage that counts against your Free Tier limits, you can stop the instance now and then start it again later.

Security • Manage access to AWS resources and APIs using identity federation with an identity provider and IAM roles whenever possible. For more information, see Creating IAM policies in the IAM User Guide. • Implement the least permissive rules for your security group. • Regularly patch, update, and secure the operating system and applications on your instance. For more information, see Update management. For guidelines speciﬁc to Windows operating systems, see Security best practices for Windows instances. • Use Amazon Inspector to automatically discover and scan Amazon EC2 instances for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure. For more information, see the Amazon Inspector User Guide. • Use AWS Security Hub controls to monitor your Amazon EC2 resources against security best practices and security standards. For more information about using Security Hub, see Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud",
  "and security standards. For more information about using Security Hub, see Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud controls in the AWS Security Hub User Guide. Storage • Understand the implications of the root device type for data persistence, backup, and recovery. For more information, see Root device type. • Use separate Amazon EBS volumes for the operating system versus your data. Ensure that the volume with your data persists after instance termination. For more information, see Preserve data when an instance is terminated. • Use the instance store available for your instance to store temporary data. Remember that the data stored in instance store is deleted when you stop, hibernate, or terminate your instance. If you use instance store for database storage, ensure that you have a cluster with a replication factor that ensures fault tolerance. • Encrypt EBS volumes and snapshots. For more information, see Amazon EBS encryption in the Amazon EBS User Guide. 17 Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide Resource management • Use instance metadata and custom resource tags to track and identify your AWS resources. For more information, see Use instance metadata to manage your EC2 instance and Tag your Amazon EC2 resources. • View your current limits for Amazon EC2. Plan to request any limit increases in advance of the time that you'll need them. For more information, see Amazon EC2 service quotas. • Use AWS Trusted Advisor to inspect your AWS environment, and then make recommendations when opportunities exist to save money, improve system availability and performance, or help close security gaps. For more information, see AWS Trusted Advisor in the AWS Support User Guide. Backup and recovery • Regularly back up your EBS volumes using Amazon EBS snapshots, and create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from your instance to save the conﬁguration as a template",
  "an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from your instance to save the conﬁguration as a template for launching future instances. For more information about AWS services that help achieve this use case, see AWS Backup and Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager. • Deploy critical components of your application across multiple Availability Zones, and replicate your data appropriately. • Design your applications to handle dynamic IP addressing when your instance restarts. For more information, see Amazon EC2 instance IP addressing. • Monitor and respond to events. For more information, see Monitor Amazon EC2 resources. • Ensure that you are prepared to handle failover.

Networking • Set the time-to-live (TTL) value for your applications to 255, for IPv4 and IPv6. If you use a smaller value, there is a risk that the TTL will expire while application traﬃc is in transit, causing reachability issues for your instances. 18 Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide Amazon Machine Images in Amazon EC2 An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is an image that provides the software that is required to set up and boot an Amazon EC2 instance. Each AMI also contains a block device mapping that speciﬁes the block devices to attach to the instances that you launch. You must specify an AMI when you launch an instance. The AMI must be compatible with the instance type that you chose for your instance. You can use an AMI",
  "with the instance type that you chose for your instance. You can use an AMI provided by AWS, a public AMI, an AMI that someone else shared with you, or an AMI that you purchased from the AWS Marketplace. An AMI is speciﬁc to the following: • Region • Operating system • Processor architecture • Root device type • Virtualization type You can launch multiple instances from a single AMI when you require multiple instances with the same conﬁguration. You can use diﬀerent AMIs to launch instances when you require instances with diﬀerent conﬁgurations, as shown in the following diagram. 19 Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide You can create an AMI from your Amazon EC2 instances and then use it to launch instances with the same conﬁguration. You can copy an AMI to another AWS Region, and then use it to launch instances in that Region. You can also share an AMI that you created with other accounts so that they can launch instances with the same conﬁguration. You can sell your AMI using the AWS Marketplace.
