  "AWS Wavelength Developer Guide What is AWS Wavelength? AWS Wavelength enables developers to build applications that require edge computing infrastructure to deliver low latency to mobile devices and end users or increase the resiliency of their existing edge applications. Wavelength deploys standard AWS compute and storage services to the edge of communications service providers' (CSP) networks. You can extend a virtual private cloud (VPC) to one or more Wavelength Zones. You can then use AWS resources such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to run the applications that require low latency or edge resiliency within the Wavelength Zone, while seamlessly communicating back to your existing AWS services deployed in the parent AWS Region. For more information, see AWS Wavelength. Wavelength concepts The following are the key concepts: • Wavelength — A new type of AWS infrastructure designed to run workloads that require low latency or edge resiliency. • Wavelength Zone — A zone in the carrier location where the Wavelength infrastructure is deployed. Wavelength Zones are associated with an AWS Region. A Wavelength Zone is a logical extension of the Region, and is managed by the control plane in the Region. • VPC — A customer virtual private cloud (VPC) that spans Availability Zones, Local Zones, and Wavelength Zones, and has deployed resources such as Amazon EC2 instances in the subnets that are associated with the zones. • Wavelength subnet — A subnet that you create in a Wavelength Zone. You can create one or more subnets, and then run and manage AWS services, such as Amazon EC2 instances, in the subnet. • Carrier gateway — A carrier gateway serves two purposes. It allows inbound traﬃc from a carrier network in a speciﬁc location, and allows outbound traﬃc to the carrier network and internet. • Network Border Group",
  "location, and allows outbound traﬃc to the carrier network and internet. • Network Border Group — A unique set of Availability Zones, Local Zones, or Wavelength Zones from which AWS advertises IP addresses. • Wavelength application — An application that you run on an AWS resource in a Wavelength Zone. Wavelength concepts 1 AWS Wavelength Developer Guide AWS resources on Wavelength You can create Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon EBS volumes, and Amazon VPC subnets and carrier gateways in Wavelength Zones. You can also use the following: • Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling • Amazon EKS clusters • Amazon ECS clusters • Amazon EC2 Systems Manager • Amazon CloudWatch • AWS CloudTrail • AWS CloudFormation • Application Load Balancer in select Wavelength Zones. For a list of these Zones, see Load balancing. The services in Wavelength are part of a VPC that is connected over a reliable connection to an AWS Region for easy access to services running in Regional subnets. Working with Wavelength You can create, access, and manage your EC2 resources, Wavelength Zones, and carrier gateways using any of the following interfaces: • AWS Management Console— Provides a web interface that you can use to access your Wavelength resources. • AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) — Provides commands for a broad set of AWS services, including Amazon VPC, and is supported on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The services you use in Wavelength continue to use their own namespace, for example Amazon EC2 uses the \"ec2\" namespace, and Amazon EBS uses the \"ebs\" namespace. For more information, see AWS Command Line Interface. • AWS SDKs — Provides language-speciﬁc APIs and takes care of many of the connection details, such as calculating signatures, handling request retries, and handling errors. For more information, see AWS SDKs. When you use any of the",
  "and handling errors. For more information, see AWS SDKs. When you use any of the interfaces for your Wavelength Zones, use the parent Region.

Use cases for AWS Wavelength Using AWS Wavelength Zones can help you accomplish a variety of goals. This section lists a few to give you an idea of the possibilities. Contents • Online betting and regulated industries • Media and entertainment • Healthcare • Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) • Connected vehicles • Smart factories • Real-time gaming Online betting and regulated industries AWS Wavelength provides edge resiliency to help address data residency requirements for regulated industries, such as online sports betting. Using a combination of AWS Wavelength alongside existing AWS hybrid and edge services such as AWS Outposts or AWS Local Zones, you can create highly-available architectures within state or country borders. Media and entertainment Wavelength provides the low latency needed to live stream high-resolution video and high-ﬁdelity audio, and to embed interactive experiences into live video streams. Real-time video analytics provide the ability to generate real-time statistics that enhance the live event experience. Healthcare Using AWS Wavelength, medical training providers can oﬀer mobile games, medical simulations for rare disease diagnosis, advanced endoscopic maneuvers, ultrasound equipment and much more. Pricing 3 AWS Wavelength Developer Guide Using AWS Wavelength to host the remote rendering engine, doctors can experience an immersive training experience without procuring the often-required expensive equipment to do so. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) By accessing compute resources on AWS Wavelength, AR/VR applications can reduce the Motion to Photon (MTP) latencies to the benchmark that is needed to oﬀer a realistic customer experience. When you use AWS Wavelength, you can oﬀer AR/VR in",
  "oﬀer a realistic customer experience. When you use AWS Wavelength, you can oﬀer AR/VR in locations where it is not possible to run local system servers. Connected vehicles Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) is an increasingly important platform for enabling functionality such as intelligent driving, real-time HD maps, and increased road safety. Low latency access to the compute infrastructure that's needed to run data processing and analytics on AWS Wavelength enables real-time monitoring of data from sensors on the vehicle. This allows for secure connectivity, in-car telematics, and autonomous driving. Smart factories Industrial automation applications use ML inference at the edge to analyze images and videos to detect quality issues on fast moving assembly lines and to trigger actions that address the issues. With AWS Wavelength, these applications can be deployed without having to use expensive, GPUbased servers on the factory ﬂoor. Real-time gaming Real-time game streaming depends on low latency to preserve the user experience. With AWS Wavelength, you can stream the most demanding games from Wavelength Zones so that they are available on end devices that have limited processing power. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) 4 AWS Wavelength Developer Guide How AWS Wavelength works The following diagram demonstrates how you can create a subnet that uses resources in a communications service provider (CSP) network at a speciﬁc location. For resources that must be deployed to the Wavelength Zone, ﬁrst opt in to the Wavelength Zone, and then create resources in the Wavelength Zone. Contents • VPCs • Subnets • Carrier gateways • Carrier IP address • Routing • DNS • Maximum transmission unit VPCs After you create a VPC in a Region, create a subnet in a Wavelength Zone that is associated with the VPC. In addition to the Wavelength Zone, you can create resources in all of",
  "the VPC. In addition to the Wavelength Zone, you can create resources in all of the Availability Zones and Local Zones that are associated with the VPC. VPCs 5 AWS Wavelength Developer Guide You have control over the VPC networking components, such as IP address assignment, subnets, and route table creation. VPCs that contain a subnet in a Wavelength Zone can connect to a carrier gateway. A carrier gateway allows you to connect to the following resources: • 4G/LTE and 5G devices on the telecommunication carrier network • Internet access including ﬁxed wireless access for select Wavelength Zone partners. For more information, see Multi-access AWS Wavelength. • Outbound traﬃc to public internet resources Subnets Any subnet that you create in a Wavelength Zone inherits the main VPC route table, which includes the local route. The local route enables connectivity between the subnets in the VPC, including the subnets that are in the Wavelength Zone. AWS recommends that you conﬁgure custom route tables for your subnets in Wavelength Zones. The destinations are the same destinations as a subnet in an Availability Zone or Local Zone, with the addition of a carrier gateway. For more information, see the section called “Routing”. Carrier gateways A carrier gateway serves two purposes. It allows inbound traﬃc from a carrier network in a speciﬁc location, and it allows outbound traﬃc to the carrier network and internet. There is no inbound connection conﬁguration from the internet to a Wavelength Zone through the carrier gateway. A carrier gateway supports IPv4 traﬃc. Carrier gateways are only available for VPCs that contain subnets in a Wavelength Zone. The carrier gateway provides connectivity between your Wavelength Zone and the telecommunication carrier, and devices on the telecommunication carrier network. The carrier gateway performs NAT of the Wavelength instances' IP addresses to the",
  "carrier network. The carrier gateway performs NAT of the Wavelength instances' IP addresses to the Carrier IP addresses from a pool that is assigned to the network border group. The carrier gateway NAT function is similar to how an internet gateway functions in a Region. Subnets 6 AWS Wavelength Developer Guide Carrier IP address A Carrier IP address is the address that you assign to a network interface, which resides in a subnet in a Wavelength Zone (for example an EC2 instance). The carrier gateway uses the address for traﬃc from the interface to the internet or to mobile devices. The carrier gateway uses NAT to translate the address, and then sends the traﬃc to the destination. Traﬃc from the telecommunication carrier network routes through the carrier gateway. You allocate a Carrier IP address from a network border group, which is a unique set of Availability Zones, Local Zones, or Wavelength Zones from which AWS advertises IP addresses, for example, us-east-1-wl1-bos-wlz-1. Routing You can set the carrier gateway as a destination in a route table for the following resources: • VPCs that contain subnets in a Wavelength Zone • Subnets in Wavelength Zones Create a custom route table for the subnets in the Wavelength Zones so that the default route goes to the carrier gateway, which then sends traﬃc to the internet and telecommunication carrier network. Example: Carrier gateway routing to the public internet Consider a scenario with the following conﬁguration: • A VPC with Availability Zones and a Wavelength Zone • A subnet in the Wavelength Zone • An EC2 instance in the subnet in the Wavelength Zone • A Carrier IP address for the network interface associated with the EC2 instance • An IP address association that maps the private IP address of the EC2 instance to the",
  "IP address association that maps the private IP address of the EC2 instance to the Carrier IP address Carrier IP address 7 AWS Wavelength Developer Guide You need the following entries in the Wavelength subnet route table. Destination Target Notes VPC CIDR Local This route allows for intraVPC connectivity, including subnets in the Availability Zones. 0.0.0.0/0 carrier-gateway-id The Carrier IP address provides internet connectivity through the carrier gateway. Carrier gateway access to the public internet The carrier gateway provides access to the internet from your Wavelength subnets. For information about protocol considerations, see the section called “Networking considerations”. Traﬃc initiated from the EC2 instance for the internet uses the 0.0.0.0/0 route to route traﬃc to the carrier gateway. The carrier gateway maps the EC2 instance IP address to the Carrier IP address, and then sends the traﬃc to the telecommunication carrier. Example: Carrier gateway routing to the public internet 8 AWS Wavelength Developer Guide DNS EC2 instances use EC2 DNS to resolve domain names to IP addresses. Route 53 supports DNS features, such as domain registration, and DNS routing. Both public and private hosted Wavelength Zones are supported for routing traﬃc to speciﬁc domains. Route 53 resolvers are hosted in the Region. You can also use your own DNS services to resolve domain names. Maximum transmission unit Generally, the maximum transmission unit (MTU) is as follows: • 9001 bytes between EC2 instances in the same Wavelength Zone. • 1500 bytes between carrier gateway and a Wavelength Zone. • 1500 bytes between an EC2 instance in a Wavelength Zone and an EC2 instance in the Region when the traﬃc uses a public IP address. • 1300 bytes between an EC2 instance in a Wavelength Zone and an EC2 instance in the Region when the traﬃc uses a private IP address. DNS",

  "Developer Guide Carrier gateway for AWS Wavelength A carrier gateway serves two purposes. It allows inbound traﬃc from a carrier network in a speciﬁc location, and it allows outbound traﬃc to the carrier network and the internet. There is generally no inbound connection conﬁguration from the internet to a Wavelength Zone through the carrier gateway with the exception of select partners. For more information, see Multi-access AWS Wavelength. A carrier gateway supports IPv4 traﬃc. Carrier gateways are only available for VPCs that contain subnets in a Wavelength Zone. The carrier gateway provides connectivity between your Wavelength Zone and the carrier, and devices on the carrier network. The carrier gateway performs NAT of the Wavelength instances' IP addresses to the Carrier IP addresses from a pool that is assigned to the network border group. The carrier gateway NAT function is similar to how an internet gateway functions in a Region. Enable access to the carrier network To enable access to or from the carrier network for instances in a Wavelength subnet, you must do the following: • Create a VPC. • Create a carrier gateway and attach the carrier gateway to your VPC. When you create the carrier gateway, you can optionally choose which subnets route to the carrier gateway. When you select this option, we automatically create the resources related to carrier gateways, such as route tables and network ACLs. If you do not choose this option, then you must perform the following tasks: • Select the subnets that route traﬃc to the carrier gateway. • Ensure that your subnet route tables have a route that directs traﬃc to the carrier gateway. • Ensure that instances in your subnet have a globally unique Carrier IP address. • Ensure that your network access control lists and security group rules allow the",
